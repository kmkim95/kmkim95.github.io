I am a first-year M.S./Ph.D. student in the [Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.postech.ac.kr/) at Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea. Current research interests largely lie in the safe and trustworthy deployment of large language models via principled uncertainty quantification and mitigation methods. I am fortunate to be advised by [Sangdon Park](https://sangdon.github.io/). I am a member of the [Machine Learning](https://ml.postech.ac.kr/) group.

While pursuing an M.S. in Industrial Management and Engineering at the same university advised by [Minwoo Chae](https://sds.postech.ac.kr/), I have worked on a number of statistical data analysis projects applying Bayesian and computational statistics methodologies. I earned a B.S. in Statistics at Korea University.
