I am a first-year M.S./Ph.D. student in the [Graduate School of AI](https://ai.postech.ac.kr/) and a member of the [Machine Learning Lab](https://ml.postech.ac.kr/) at POSTECH, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Sangdon Park](https://sangdon.github.io/). My current research interests largely lie in the safe and trustworthy deployment of large language models.

While pursuing an M.S. in Industrial Management and Engineering at the same university advised by [Minwoo Chae](https://sds.postech.ac.kr/), I worked on a number of statistical data analysis projects in the industry domain, applying Bayesian and computational statistics methodologies. Prior to joining POSTECH, I also worked as a student researcher in the [Design Informatics Lab](https://designinformatics.hanyang.ac.kr/) at Hanyang University, where I developed a computational interaction algorithm that assists users in efficiently searching the design space based on the concept of Bayesian information gain. I earned a B.E. in Statistics at Korea University.
