I am a first-year M.S./Ph.D. student in the [Graduate School of AI](https://ai.postech.ac.kr/) and a member of the [Machine Learning](https://ml.postech.ac.kr/) lab at POSTECH, where I am fortunate to advised by [Sangdon Park](https://sangdon.github.io/).

While pursuing an M.S. in Industrial Management and Engineering at the same university advised by [Minwoo Chae](https://sds.postech.ac.kr/), I have worked on a number of statistical data analysis projects applying Bayesian and computational statistics methodologies. I earned a B.S. in Statistics at Korea University.
