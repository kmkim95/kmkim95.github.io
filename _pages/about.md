I am a first-year M.S./Ph.D. student in the [Graduate School of AI](https://ai.postech.ac.kr/) and a member of the [Machine Learning Lab](https://ml.postech.ac.kr/) at POSTECH, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Sangdon Park](https://sangdon.github.io/). My current research interests largely lie in the safe and trustworthy deployment of large language models.

While pursuing an M.S. in Industrial Management and Engineering at the same university advised by [Minwoo Chae](https://sds.postech.ac.kr/), I have worked on a number of statistical data analysis projects applying Bayesian and computational statistics methodologies. Prior to join POSTECH, I worked as a student researcher in the [Design Informatics Lab](https://designinformatics.hanyang.ac.kr/) at Hanyang University, where I devised a computational interaction algorithm which aids the user to efficiently search over the design space based on the Bayesian information gain criteria. I earned a B.S. in Statistics at Korea University.
